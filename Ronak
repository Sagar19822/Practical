Dear [Sir/Madam],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence from my upcoming examinations due to a very important family event. My brother’s wedding is scheduled to take place on [date of the wedding], and as a close family member, it is essential for me to attend and support the family during this special occasion.

The wedding coincides with my examinations, and I kindly request your permission to be granted leave for the examination(s) falling between [start date of leave] and [end date of leave]. I assure you that I will make up for any missed work or assignments upon my return, and I will adhere to any procedures for rescheduling the examination(s) as per the university’s policy.

I understand the importance of the examinations, and I sincerely hope for your understanding and approval of my request. Please let me know if any further documentation or formalities are required.

Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,
